            <h2>What is a sequence?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A sequence is an ordered list of elements or objects, known as terms, where repetition is possible, and the order does matter. A sequence can be made up of anything, but typically it is a list of numbers or other mathematical objects. An example of a sequence is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,..., where each element is the sum of the two previous elements, and the sequence goes on infinitely. This sequence is known as the Fibonacci sequence.</li>
                <li>My sequence was though of by me in 4th grade. At that point, I hadn't heard of it, but the sequence is known as the triangle numbers, which I found this out doing this project. It is called that because if you make a triangle, adding points to expand the triangle makes the same sequence. The sequence looks like a parabola when graphed, and grows exponentially (to my knowledge).</li>
